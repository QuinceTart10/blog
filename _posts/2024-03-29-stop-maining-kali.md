title: STOP maining Kali Linux

Over my time on the internet I've noticed a lot of newbies trying out Linux using Kali as their first distro, probably because it's the *"l33t h4xx0r linux"*, which is true, but not in the way that you should use it as a regular user.

Kali Linux is a distribution meant for penetration testing and ethical hacking, so it's very hardened and prepackaged with security tools. Nothing out of that is useful or needed for a regular user. In fact, the system is hardened so much that it can even be counter-productive for the user.

If you're a new user who either got sent this article or found it through a search, I'd rather recommend something like Xubuntu, Kubuntu or Linux Mint for you to use, as those are made to be used by a regular user on a day to day basis.

I know that Arch can provide a bad experience to first time users too, but unlike Kali it's actually meant to be dailydriven, so I weigh Arch as a better overall experience, even if it doesn't have a preinstalled GUI.
