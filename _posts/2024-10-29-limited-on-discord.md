Soo.. I got limited on Discord aand it kinda sucks. It literally happened so randomly: one second I was talking to a friend, and then I got a DM from Discord telling me that my account has been limited, which means that I can't talk and stuff like that.

The issue is that you usually want your friends to know that your account is fucked, but you can't because they stripped that permission from you.

This is kinda fucked up. You joke about something and get silenced for a day because some smartass reported you. We should start embracing decentralized communication platforms that we actually own.

I might also work a little on this blog to make it nicer and maybe even post more to it. Rant over.
